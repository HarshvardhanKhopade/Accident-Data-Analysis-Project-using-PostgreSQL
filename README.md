7. Are there any relationships between journey purposes and the severity of accidents?
8. Calculate the average age of vehicles involved in accidents , considering Day light and point of impact?
9. Analyze accident severity in relation to various factors, including weather conditions, road conditions, and lighting conditions.
10. Which area has the highest frequency of accidents for all vehicle types where the number of accidents has reached 1000?
11. Which area has the Lowest frequency of accidents for a specific vehicle type?

The travel department can use these findings to improve road safety for travelers. For example, they can:
Identify areas with high accident rates and focus safety efforts in those areas.
Educate travelers about the risks of driving in certain conditions, such as icy roads or heavy rain.
Encourage drivers to take precautions to avoid accidents, such as wearing seatbelts and driving at a safe speed.
By taking these steps, the travel department can help to make roads safer for everyone.
